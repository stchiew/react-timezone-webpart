### Overwrite local files from remote

If you feel the need to discard all your local changes and just reset/overwrite everything with a copy from the remote branch then you should follow this guide.

Important: If you have any local changes, they will be lost. With or without --hard option, any local commits that havenâ€™t been pushed will be lost.
If you have any files that are not tracked by Git (e.g. uploaded user content), these files will not be affected.

The Overwrite workflow:
To overwrite your local files do:

```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard <remote>/<branch_name>
```

For example:

```
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/master
```

### How to Clone a Specific Branch

You can

- Clone the repository and fetch only a single branch.

```
git clone -b <branchname> --single-branch <remote-repo-url> (e.g. git@github.com:stchiew/react-is-fun.git)
```
